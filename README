moshPyTT
==============================================================================

moshPyTT is a program to read, display and modify Tesseract boxfiles, which is
a crucial step when training Tesseract. It is intended to be faster and less
resource-intensive that previous programs.

It is based on pyTesseractTrainer, which in turn was based on
tesseractTrainer.py. The following people created those programs:
    Zdenko Podobný <zdenop at gmail.com>
    Mihail Radu Solcan (djvused and image maps)
    Cătălin Frâncu <cata at francu.com>

Autotrain.py is a utility script to take boxfile/image pairs and distill down
to a "traineddata" file, which is otherwise a long and tedious process.


Requirements
=====================

All scripts need Python:
* Python (2.6 works, lower versions probably work too)

moshPyTT:
 ** pyGTK (2.0 or higher)

Autotrain:
 ** Tesseract


Installation & Running
=====================

There is no installation.

    moshPyTT
    ============
    Run "python moshpytt.py [-i optional image name]" from any directory.

    Autotrain.py
    ============
    From the directory containing the boxfile/image pairs, run
    "...../moshpytt/autotrain.py"

    This is because the Tesseract tools only produce the files in the
    current working directory.

    You may need to run with elevated priveleges in order for the script to
    move the generated files to the "tessdata" directory if that directory is
    in a protected area (eg /usr/)

bugzilla at:
  http://code.google.com/p/moshpytt/issues/list

If you would like to submit a patch, please create a diff (against the most
recent version, a *lot* of code can change between versions), and attach it to
the bug report. I would suggest creating a bug report before starting work so
I can hold off making changes that make merging your patch harder.
